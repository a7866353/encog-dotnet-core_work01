Sharpe Ratio: 0.16
One of the most important ratios between the profitability and the risk. Sharp Ratio shows by how many times the arithmetic mean exceeds the standard deviation from the equity volatility. For example, Sharp=0.6 means that there is an average risk to lose 10 dollars per a profit of 6 dollars. The larger is this value, the less risky is the trading. However, large profit values in individual trades can result in larger value of the standard deviation that, in its turn, results in unreasonable decreasing of Sharp Ratio.
